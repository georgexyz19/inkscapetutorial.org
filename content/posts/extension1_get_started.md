## What Is Inkscape Extension?

Before we start developing Inkscape extensions (or plugins), let's look at one simple 
built-in extension and understand what's an Inkscape extension. 

After we launch Inkscape, click menu `Extensions -> Render -> Triangle...`. A new dialog 
will pop up on screen and it looks like this.  

<div style="max-width:300px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext1/ext1-triangle.png" alt="Triangle Ext Window"> 
</div>

If we click the `apply` button, the extension will draw a triangle on the Inkscape canvas. 
The three sides of the triangle are all of 100 px length.  We can also toggle the `live preview` 
box on to show a preview of the triangle. Obviously when the `Mode` is set to 
`From Three Sides` on the dialog, the extension program ignores the three `Angle` values. 

<div style="max-width:300px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext1/ext1-triangle-drawing.svg" alt="Triangle drawing"> 
</div>

Let's change the `Side length a (px)` value to 50 and re-apply the extension.  The program 
will draw a triangle like this.  We know the side on the right hand is `a`. 

<div style="max-width:300px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext1/ext1-triangle-drawing-2.svg" alt="Triangle drawing 2"> 
</div>

Next let's try to enter an invalid number and see the result.  Change the `Side length a (px)` 
value to 250. Note the length of a triangle side can't be longer than the sum of other two sides. 
The program will generate this error message. 

<div style="max-width:400px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext1/ext1-error.png" alt="Triangle error"> 
</div>

## What Extensions Can Do?

The Inkscape itself comes with many extensions which are listed under the `Extensions` menu. 
Some of the extensions are intuitive to use such as `Gear`, `Grid`, and `Calendar`. 

The real power of the Inkscape extension system is that we can treat it as an API (Application 
Programming Interface). 
It provides many classes and functions 
on which programmers can build user extensions. 

[WriteTeX](https://github.com/wanglongqi/WriteTeX) is an extension serving as a 
LaTeX/TeX editor for Inkscape.  We can insert math equations onto an Inkscape drawing
with this tool. 
Here is an example drawing with equations on the right hand side. 

<div style="max-width:800px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext1/ext1-hcurve.svg" alt="H Curve"> 
</div>

The drawing below shows a small portion of a large sign poster file which is created 
with an Inkscape extension. The [full size poster file](/files/ext1/signposter.pdf) contains
about 700 sign drawings. 

<div style="max-width:800px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext1/ext1-poster.svg" alt="poster"> 
</div>

## Extension Programs

Most Inkscape extensions are written in Python programming language. If you are not familiar 
with Python, 
[the official python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) is a good start point. 

Let's find out where the extension programs are located.  Click the menu `Edit -> Preferences` 
in Inkscape and choose `System` on the left panel. We can find two extension directory 
settings. The value in `User extensions` field is shown below.

```
/home/george/.config/inkscape/extensions
```

And below is the value of `Inkscape extensions` field.  We also call this `system 
extensions` directory. 

```
/usr/share/inkscape/extensions
```

My computer runs Ubuntu 21.04 OS, and Inkscape 1.1 is installed through 
`apt` commands as suggested on 
[this webpage](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/05/inkscape-1-1-released-new-features). If you are running 
Inkscape under other OS, the directories will be different. In Windows, the two 
directory paths look like the two lines shown below. 

```
C:\Users\<User Name>\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions
D:\app_work\inkscape-1.1-x64\inkscape\share\inkscape\extensions
```

The `user extensions` refers to extensions created by you as an Inkscape user (or programmer). The 
`inkscape extensions` or `system extensions` refers to the programs that come with 
the Inkscape installation. We could put our extensions in the `inkscape extensions` 
directory and vice versa.  They will run just fine. But it is better to separate them into two 
directories. 

We can add two aliases to the `~/.bashrc` file to have easier access to those two 
directories when we are developing extensions in Ubuntu.  This is for Linux users only. 

```
alias cdsysdir='cd /usr/share/inkscape/extensions'
alias cduserdir='cd ~/.config/inkscape/extensions'
```

## System Extensions

Let's check the `system extensions` directory and see what is in there. 
The Linux commands below show that the directory has a total of 554 files and 
226 Python files. The fourth command below indicates that the Python files have 
a total of 43,979 lines of code for Inkscape 1.1. 

```bash
cd /usr/share/inkscape/extensions
find . -type f | wc -l        # 554  
find . -name '*.py' | wc -l   # 226
find . -name '*.py' -exec wc -l '{}' +    #43,979
```

The system extensions have lots of code, and it's almost impossible for 
one person to read and understand all of them.  This extension tutorial series
will try to discuss and explain a small subset of those files.  

If you want to take part in developing or improving system extensions, 
this gitlab source code repository is the place to get started.

## Inkscape Version and Extension

Inkscape versions 0.91 and 0.92 already come with many extensions. However they are 
mostly written in Python 2. Even though Python 3.4 is released back in 2014 and 
many people have been writing programs in Python 3. Inkscape extensions are in 
Python 2 for many years. The 
reason is that most system extensions are created by various developers over time
and it requires some serious work to convert them to Python 3. The root problem is 
that Python 3 is not compatible with Python 2. 

Finally with the Inkscape 1.0 release, the extensions are upgraded to Python 3. 
The Inkscape 1.1 extensions require Python 3.6 and above. The drawback is that 
new extensions (third party) for Inkscape 1.0 & 1.1 are incompatible with older Inkscape, 
and old extensions are incompatible with new Inkscape. 

If you somehow get an 
old Inkscape extension which does not work in Inkscape 1.1, try to load it 
in Inkscape 0.92.X and it may work well. 

## Objectives

This tutorial series is developed from my notes.  It's not as formal 
as a typical book or software manual, but it's in a much better shape than 
my notes. I am trying to point the right direction for people who are 
interested to learn more about Inkscape extension development.
